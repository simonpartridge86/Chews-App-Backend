# Backend for "Chews" App

This is the back-end repo for "Chews", a mobile-first web app made as part of final project month at the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) bootcamp (August 2022) by [Simon Partridge](https://github.com/simonpartridge86), [Adam Phasey](https://github.com/AdamPhasey), [Sam Wylie](https://github.com/samsonhumber), [Maurizio Monti](https://github.com/mauriziomonti), [Kunal Shukla](https://github.com/kun-shukla) and [Mino Devito](https://github.com/MagicMino).

For details about the project front-end and app design, please see the corresponding [front-end repo here](https://github.com/simonpartridge86/baristacrats-frontend-final-project).

## Description

This repo contains details of the server and database created for Chews app, including API routes, PostgreSQL queries, and tests. Our API routes are connected to a Heroku database and requested data is sent to the front-end via various GET routes. Each GET route is distilled by our server into a single fetch request to an external API, [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php), to obtain recipe data.

The backend can be tested in deployment [here](https://chews-backend.herokuapp.com/).

## Back-End Tools

![Back-end tools](./images/backend-tech.png)

We chose to construct our back-end using technologies learned during the School of Code bootcamp, namely Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Heroku. This helped to consolidate our learning from the bootcamp process.

Heroku was used for both database hosting and back-end deployment.
